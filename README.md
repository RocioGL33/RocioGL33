- üöÄ It's Rocio, Frontend Developer from Argentina. 

I started my studies in the midst of a pandemic, where I decided that this was the world where I wanted to develop professionally. Since then, I find myself creating websites where I try to improve more and more, since I am a very detailed and creative person.

Already received at the Henry bootcamp as a Full Stack Developer, I have added more than 800 hours of learning in contact with technologies such as: **HTML, JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, CSS, etc**
