- üöÄ I'm Rocio Garcia, Full Stack Developer from Argentina. 

I started my studies in the midst of a pandemic, where I decided that this was the world where I wanted to develop professionally. Since then, I find myself creating websites where I try to improve more and more, since I am a very detailed person.

Already received at the Henry bootcamp, I have added more than 800 hours of learning in contact with technologies such as: **HTML, JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, CSS and currently perfecting myself in the world of UX-UI design, using Figma and AdobeXD as main tools**
